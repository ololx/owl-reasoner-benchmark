##  üìñ About

This is a console java application that allows the speed evaluating OWL 2 reasoners on a specified ontologies. This application was implemented in the evaluating owl 2 reasoning process for the `ORE 2014` paper.

### Motivation

During developing a model for representing the relational databases semantics in DL axioms and assetions, it was necessary to evaluate the reasoning speed of such a solution. This benchmark was developed and allowed to evaluate the reasoning speed of OWL 2 reasoners (such as TReasoner, Hermit, Fact++). The results of this evaluating were presented at `OWL Reasoner Evaluation Workshop 2014` in this article http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1207/paper_8.pdf.

## üì∏ Demo

These pictures demonstrate the benchmark results examples (time in ns).

## üéö Features

- Choose reasoners and run an estimate of the time spent on the selected resonators on a set of ontologies;

### To Do

- ~~For more information on an upcoming development, please read the todo list.~~ No plans.

### Changelog

- For more information on a releases, a features and a changes, please read the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) notes.

## üö¶ Getting Started

These instructions allow to get a copy of this project and run it on a local machine.

### Installing

In order to install it is quite simple to clone or download this repository.

### Cloning

For the cloning this repository to a local machine, just use the follows link:

```http
https://github.com/ololx/owl2-reasoners-benchmark
```

### Using

To use it is necessary to:
1 - Build the project (via IDE tools or Ant).
2 - Configure the `OWL2ReasonersBenchmark`.
3 - Launch the `OWL2ReasonersBenchmark`.

### Configuring

It is possible to set test parameters (rezoners, folder with test data, folder for saving results, etc.) via the configuration file `cfg.ini`. The example of configurations is presented below:

```cfg
SEPARATOR = ;
RESULTS_DIR = E:
TEST_DIR = E:/q
REASONERS_LIST = HErmit;Treasoner
REASONING_LIST = CONSISTENT
TEST_ITERATION = 1
DELAY_BETWEEN_ITERATION = 17
```

### Launching

- Firstly, it is necessary to put ontologies in the directory defined as `TEST_DIR` in `cfg.ini`.
![The input dir with test data](https://github.com/ololx/owl2-reasoners-benchmark/blob/assets/demo/owl2-reasoner-benchmark-demo-input.png?raw=true)
- To execute this benchmark.

- After execution the benchmark results will be in the directory defined as `RESULTS_DIR` in `cfg.ini`.
