# owl2-reasoner-benchmark

This is ta console java application that allows the speed evaluating OWL 2 reasoners on a specified ontologies. This application was implemented in the evaluating owl 2 reasoning process for the ORE 2013 paper.

##  üìñ About

This is ta console java application that allows the speed evaluating OWL 2 reasoners on a specified ontologies. This application was implemented in the evaluating owl 2 reasoning process for the ORE 2013 paper.

### Motivation

During developing a model for representing the relational databases semantics in DL axioms and assetions, it was necessary to evaluate the reasoning speed of such a solution. This benchmark was developed and allowed to evaluate the reasoning speed of OWL 2 reasoners (such as TReasoner, Hermit, Fact++). The results of this evaluating were presented at ORE 2013 in this article http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1207/paper_8.pdf.
